 Merge overlapping intervals
 The goal of this exercise is to merge all the overlapping intervals of a given list to produce a list that has only mutually exclusive intervals.

 Problem statement: You have an array (list) of interval pairs as input where each interval has a start and end timestamp, sorted by starting timestamps. Merge the overlapping intervals and return a new output array.

 Consider an input array below. Intervals (1, 5), (3, 7), (4, 6), (6, 8) are overlapping so they should be merged to one interval (1, 8). Similarly, intervals (10, 12) and (12, 15) are also overlapping and should be merged to (10, 15).
